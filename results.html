            <p>"It is estimated that industrialised countries lose between 2 and 4 percent of their GDP each year due to the effects of friction.” </p><span>Lars Pleth Nielsen, Manager of the Tribology Center at the Danish Technological Institute and President of ENIWEP (the European Network for Industrial Wear Prevention)</span>
          </div>
          <h2>The technology</h2>
          <p>Many years ago, those behind Lofrix developed a radically new way of dealing with the harmful effects of friction. The main distinguishing feature of this new technology was that it did not contain any particulates, even at a micro level, whereas existing technologies at the time contained solid particulates which, over extended periods, often caused significant harm to the plant and equipment into which they were introduced.</p>
          <p>A lengthy programme of testing and trialling the technology was conducted with the co-operation of a number of large engineering companies. This was followed by an ever-widening series of closely-monitored, real-life applications in different industrial sectors under varying conditions – in the renewable industry, manufacturing, aerospace, printing, paper, construction etc.</p>
          <p>This testing proved the technology was safe to use and caused no harm to plant or equipment. It also clearly demonstrated the benefits when applied to plant and equipment, for example: less energy use, reduced emissions, less heat, vibration and noise from operating equipment, and lower costs. </p>
          <h2>The company</h2>
          <p>Lofrix Associates Limited was established in 2002 as the vehicle to carry forward the technology and, until now, the company has focussed mainly on marketing applications for industrial plant, wind turbines and other heavy equipment.</p>
          <p>As well as on-going field testing, the company commissioned further extensive laboratory wear testing at the Centre for Efficiency and Performance Engineering at Huddersfield University, where it was determined that Lofrix technology provides very significant protection to metal components when added in small concentrations to conventional lubricating oils.</p>
          <h2>Lofrix Eco Gel</h2>
          <p>More recently, it has been independently demonstrated that the application of Lofrix technology in the engines and gearboxes of motor vehicles (whether diesel or petrol based) significantly reduces toxic emissions, including particulates from exhausts – as well as lowering fuel consumption. These benefits occur as a result of the following:</p>
          <ul> 
            <li>first, the Lofrix technology removes resins and carbonated oil from the engine compartment;</li>
            <li>second, it forms an unseen bond with the metal surfaces in the engine compartment;</li>
            <li>third, this bond prevents new deposits from adhering to the metal surfaces.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This results in a cleaner fuel burn and less unburnt and partly-burned fuel from exiting the exhaust as small particulates, which are dangerous to human health. This process also reduces the volume of these emissions which would otherwise increase as the engine becomes more contaminated over time.</p>
          <p>To prove the emissions reduction quality, around 100 MOT emissions tests were undertaken which showed the difference in engine emissions before and after treatment with the technology, one of the factors that has led us to offer the technology in vehicle-treatment doses to the general public.</p>

            <h3>The Nature of LOFRIX ECO GEL</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><b>LOFRIX ECO GEL</b> is an amber-coloured liquid which at room temperature has a consistency that resembles syrup.</li>
              <li>When warmed to higher temperatures then it becomes less viscous and much easier to pour and mix like a free-flowing liquid.</li>
              <li>It is not oil-based and does not blend with oil.</li>
              <li><b>LOFRIX ECO GEL</b> has no particulates in it, and when mixed with a lubricating oil it does not change the chemical composition of the oil but merely sits in suspension and is attracted to warmed metal surfaces, using the oil as a carrier to get around the system.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="does-box">
            <h3>What LOFRIX ECO GEL does</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><b>LOFRIX ECO GEL</b> initially acts as a cleanser to remove any resins, carbonated oil or other deposits adhering to the inside of the engine.</li>
              <li>In cleansing the engine, <b>LOFRIX ECO GEL</b> creates a bond with the metal surfaces. </li>
              <li>The bond acts to reduce friction between moving metal parts, and brings the benefits of less component wear plus reductions in heat, vibration and noise.  </li>
              <li><b>LOFRIX ECO GEL</b> will help to protect engine components that are not used for long periods against the effects of moisture.</li>
              <li><b>LOFRIX ECO GEL</b> will inhibit deposits from re-forming and ensure that the engine will burn more of the fuel that is introduced into the combustion chamber so that less unburnt and partly-burned fuel is emitted through the vehicle’s exhaust.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="value-box">
            <h3>THE VALUE OF LOFRIX ECO GEL</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>The cost of treating the engine of an average family car with <b>LOFRIX ECO GEL</b> is around £25 (excluding VAT). It is a treatment that is safe and easy to apply and does not need to be undertaken by a garage, as the Lofrix product is simply added to the engine compartment via the oil filler cap at approximately 1% of the volume of engine lubricating oil in the system. Re-treatment is recommended either annually or when the oil in the vehicle is changed during a service.</li>
              <li>Vehicles treated with Lofrix technology will reduce emissions, including greenhouse gases and dangerous particulates, thereby having a significant beneficial effect in reducing airborne pollution – which is a major escalating problem in urban areas.</li>
              <li>Furthermore, because there is a cleaner burn and less fuel is wasted through the vehicle exhaust, there is an overall lower fuel consumption which will save the motorist money.  </li>
              <li>In addition, the engine will be protected against undue wear and tear by the reduction of friction between moving metal parts, reducing the likelihood of mechanical breakdowns.</li>
              <li>Performance of the engine will improve after treatment, and further fuel reduction can be achieved by also adding Lofrix technology to the oil in a vehicle’s manual gearbox.</li>
